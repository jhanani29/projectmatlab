# Prognosis of lush in rice crop using Multi Class SVM
Images of ailing, typical and emerging rice crops are captured among the various delta regions in Tamilnadu(India). The image is processed using Digital image processing. The threshold values of the 3 crops are set on. These values are compared with the pre-estimated K, N, P values that are obtained using (leaf color chart)LCC. Neural network techniques are used to procure the amount of K, N, P values to be tacked on to make the crop more lush.
